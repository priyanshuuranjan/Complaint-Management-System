## 🏁 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
   REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-firebase-storage-bucket
   REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-firebase-messaging-sender-id
   REACT_APP_APP_ID=your-firebase-app-id
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 🔧 Environment Variables

If you're using Firebase, set up the required environment variables by adding your Firebase configuration details into a `.env` file in the root directory.

```bash
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-firebase-auth-domain
REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-firebase-storage-bucket
REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-firebase-messaging-sender-id
REACT_APP_APP_ID=your-firebase-app-id
